#3 NFT Contracts

This project was made following along with a lesson by fcc and includes:

1. Basic NFT

2. Random IPFS NFT
- Pros: Cheap
- Cons: Someone needs to pin our data

3. Dynamic SVG NFT
- Pros: Data is on chain
- Cons: Expensive
This NFT will change based on price of ETH. If ETH is above or below X price, the NFT will be happy or frowning face.
